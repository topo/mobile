-   **Serve images in next-gen format** 🧐 Images are a variation of
    .jpg and .png standard formats. 1) converting images is possible but
    a big task, 2) as the website is/will be maintained by students, not
    tech experts, better keep with standard formats.  
-   **plus: images are essential** they are part of the charm of TOPO
