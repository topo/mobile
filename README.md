# Mobile website for TOPO

This part of the TOPO website follows the Progressive Web App (PWA)
guidelines to deliver an experience as close as a native app as
possible,  while being easy to maintain and update.

This is a React version, that uses the power of the Wordpress REST API,
but it is adapted from a php version at <https://topolitique.ch/beta/m/>
